Comments on lines 1-7

1. Tidal model control file (ASCII, supplied with the model, starting
   from "Model_") contains AT LEAST 3 lines:

   elevation model file name
   transport model file name
   bathymetry grid file name
   {name of function to convert x,y to lon,lat}

   Leave line 1 blank, if are not sure which model to use. In this case
   all models from "model.list" are checked. File "./model.list" should
   contain all your DATA/Model_* files and is done as:

   ls -1 DATA/Model_*>model.list

   Please have all Model_* files ready in subdirectory DATA

   Please show FULL path to the model files in the "Model_*" file
   unless they are located in /DATA (download default).

   4th line in Model_* file is used ONLY for models calculated on
   uniform grid in km. Converting functions are provided with
   current version of OTPS. Please upgrade OTPS if a function is
   missing.

2. latitude, longitude and time file is an ASCII file, consisting
   either of 2 OR 8 columns:
   latitude (degrees) longitude (degrees) [yyyy mm dd hh mm ss]
   Common sign convention:
   lat>0 - degrees North, lon>0 - degrees East
   lat<0 - degrees South, lon<0 - degrees West
   [yyyy mm dd hh mm ss] - year month day hour seconds
   These 6 columns are needed for tide predictions only.
   You may leave them empty if only extracting HC

3. Extract HC/predict tide for:
   z/U/V/u/v - elevation(m) /WE transport(m^2/s)/ SN transport(m^2/s)/
                             WE velocity (cm/s) / SN velocity (cm/s)

4. Constituent names should be in LOWER case and separated by comma.
   Leave the line blank, if ALL model constituents are included

5. AP/RI - output amplitude and phase(GMT) OR real/imaginary parts.
           Only used when extracting HC.
           May leave blank, if predicting tide.

6. Only needed for tide prediction. 1/0 - Do/Not correct for the minor
   constituents defined in weights.h. Only works for 8 constituents:
   m2,s2,n2,k2,k1,o1,p1,q1

7. oce/geo - extract ocean/geocentric HC for elevations only.
            Geocentric tide is appropriate for comparison to or
            correction of altimetry data.
            May leave blank if not z on line 3.
